# README #

LogCal is a simple calendar display app for Android, API level 15 and higher, works best with 17 and higher.

It pulls information from the google calendar on your phone, and then displays it with the detail of each event decreasing the further in the future the event is. 

At this time, it only displays one week, but there are plans to expand the view further, allowing the user to scroll into the future as far as they'd like.

The idea was for the calendar to be 'logarithmic', and not depend on breakdowns of time like weeks, months, years, etc.  However it has been revised into it's current state, as the minimal amount of detail has been reached, and I do not see a point in showing less detail than is already shown (what could I do, partial event names? Seems silly). 

### What is this repository for? ###

If you're just getting into development, this app shows the basics of both displaying information, layouts, and using an API to gather info.  If you'd like to expand on my work here, feel free to do so, just follow the GPL 3.0 License agreement.

### How do I get set up? ###

Android studio project, so download and plop it in.  You'll need API level 15 or higher to compile, I created it using API level 20.  Works best on ICS and later android versions.

## Project Status

Haven't looked at this in years now.  I've decided to open source the entire project in hopes that others will be able to help contribute.  
### How Can I Help?
I'm sure the app code could use some updates, and some beautifying. Feel free to contribute by updating the app code itself.  Pull requests are welcome :).
